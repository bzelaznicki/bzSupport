# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security improvements implemented and additional
recommendations for the bzSupport application.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. JWT Secret Management ✅

- **Issue**: Hardcoded fallback JWT secret "dev-secret" allowed token forgery
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded fallback, made JWT_SECRET environment variable
  required
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized JWT creation and impersonation attacks

### 2. Security Headers ✅

- **Issue**: Missing security headers exposed application to various attacks
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive security headers middleware
- **Headers Added**:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer
    information
  - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';` -
    Restrictive CSP
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` - HTTPS enforcement (production only)

### 3. Database SSL Configuration ✅

- **Issue**: Database connections were unencrypted (ssl: false)
- **Fix**: Enable SSL by default in production, allow disabled SSL only in
  development
- **Impact**: Protects data in transit between application and database

### 4. Rate Limiting ✅

- **Issue**: No rate limiting on authentication endpoints allowed brute force
  attacks
- **Fix**: Implemented rate limiting middleware with configurable limits
- **Configuration**:
  - Login endpoint: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
  - Refresh endpoint: 10 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
- **Storage**: In-memory (consider Redis for production scaling)

### 5. Input Validation Enhancements ✅

- **Issue**: Limited input validation could lead to injection attacks or data
  corruption
- **Fix**: Enhanced validation utilities with comprehensive checks
- **Added Validations**:
  - Email format validation with length limits
  - Password complexity requirements (min 8 chars, 3 of 4 character types)
  - String sanitization to remove control characters
  - Content-type validation to prevent request smuggling

### 6. Environment Variable Security ✅

- **Issue**: Inconsistent environment variable validation
- **Fix**: Consistent use of `requireEnv` for critical variables
- **Added**: `.env.example` file documenting all required variables

## Additional Security Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Deploy with proper SSL/TLS certificates
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
   - Use HTTP/2 for better performance

2. **Database Security**
   - Use connection pooling with proper limits
   - Implement database-level user permissions
   - Regular security updates for PostgreSQL

3. **Token Security**
   - Implement token rotation for refresh tokens
   - Consider shorter JWT expiration times
   - Add token blacklisting capability

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
   - Set up alerts for security events

### Medium Priority

5. **CORS Configuration**
   - Implement proper CORS headers
   - Restrict origins in production
   - Use credentials: true only when necessary

6. **File Upload Security** (if implemented)
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploads for malware
   - Store uploads outside web root

7. **API Documentation Security**
   - Don't expose internal API structure
   - Use API versioning
   - Implement proper error handling

### Low Priority

8. **Additional Headers**
   - Consider `Permissions-Policy` header
   - Add `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` if needed
   - Implement `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`

9. **Session Security**
   - Consider session timeout mechanisms
   - Implement concurrent session limits
   - Add device/location tracking

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] JWT_SECRET is set to a cryptographically secure random value
- [ ] DATABASE_URL uses SSL connection string in production
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced with valid certificates
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured appropriately for expected traffic
- [ ] Database has proper user permissions configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are in place
- [ ] Regular security updates are scheduled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested
